## Project Recap {data-background="img/Copy of QC.png" data-background-size="cover" style="color: white"}

<font size="5">1. Develop and implement a bioinformatics pipeline

-   Deploy RStudio, Shiny, and OpenCPU servers using Docker
    -   Easy development and access: Access of the servers via a browser
        using docker
    -   From git, isolated and standalone applications can be started
        via Docker

2.  Expose a stateless microservice using RESTful API and RPC the major
    steps in scRNAseq pipeline and their visualizations
3.  Develop an interactive dashboard/reactive framework in Shiny for the
    scRNA pre-processing pipeline</font>

# Current Progress {data-background="img/Copy of QC.png" data-background-size="cover" style="color: white"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Successful trial runs ![Developed trial R package that are deployed and
accessible in OpenCPU via Git](img/r_opencpu.png){width="536"}

Deployed trial shiny package [insert here the code for the shiny package
pls thanks]

# Challenges {data-background="img/Copy of QC.png" data-background-size="cover" style="color: white"}

-   Deploy the servers using Docker
    -   Containers for the trial package are on private and yet to
        establish a host connection
-   To improve and polish scripts for future deployment
-   
-   
-   

# Next week's to-do {data-background="img/Copy of QC.png" data-background-size="cover" style="color: white"}

-   Attend lectures
-   Test run main pipeline for pre-processing of scRNA using Seurat
    package
-   Deploy the step/s of the pipeline using Docker
-
